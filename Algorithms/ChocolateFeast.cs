Problem:
Little Bob loves chocolates and goes to the store with a $N bill with $C being the price of each chocolate. 
In addition, the store offers a discount: for every M wrappers he gives the store, heâ€™ll get one chocolate 
for free. How many chocolates does Bob get to eat?

STDIN:
The first line contains the number of test cases T (<=1000).
Each of the next T lines contains three integers N, C and M.
