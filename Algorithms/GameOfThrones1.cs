Problem: 
King Robert has 7 kingdoms under his rule. He gets to know from Raven that the Dothraki are to wage a war 
against him soon. But, he knows the Dothraki need to cross the narrow river to enter his dynasty. There is 
only one bridge that connects both sides of the river which is sealed by a huge door.

The king wants to lock the door so that the Dothraki canâ€™t enter. But, to lock the door you need a key that 
is an anagram of a certain palindrome string.

The king has a list of words. For each given word, can you help the king in figuring out if any anagram of it 
can be a palindrome or not?. 

STDIN:
A single line which will contain the input string.

Constraints:
1<= length of string <= 10^5
